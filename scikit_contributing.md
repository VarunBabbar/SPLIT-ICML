# Contributing

This project is a community effort, and everyone is welcome to contribute. It is hosted on [scikit-learn/scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn). The decision making process and governance structure of scikit-learn is laid out in [Scikit-learn governance and decision-making](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/governance.html).

Scikit-learn is somewhat selective when it comes to adding new algorithms, and the best way to contribute and to help the project is to start working on known issues. See [Issues for New Contributors](#issues-for-new-contributors) to get started.

## Our Community, Our Values

We are a community based on openness and friendly, didactic, discussions.

We aspire to treat everybody equally, and value their contributions. We are particularly seeking people from underrepresented backgrounds in Open Source Software and scikit-learn in particular to participate and contribute their expertise and experience.

Decisions are made based on technical merit and consensus.

Code is not the only way to help the project. Reviewing pull requests, answering questions to help others on mailing lists or issues, organizing and teaching tutorials, working on the website, improving the documentation, are all priceless contributions.

We abide by the principles of openness, respect, and consideration of others of the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

In case you experience issues using this package, do not hesitate to submit a ticket to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues). You are also welcome to post feature requests or pull requests.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to scikit-learn, with the most common ones being contribution of code or documentation to the project. Improving the documentation is no less important than improving the library itself. If you find a typo in the documentation, or have made improvements, do not hesitate to create a GitHub issue or preferably submit a GitHub pull request. Full documentation can be found under the `doc/` directory.

But there are many other ways to help. In particular helping to improve, triage, and investigate issues and reviewing other developers' pull requests are very valuable contributions that decrease the burden on the project maintainers.

Another way to contribute is to report issues you're facing, and give a "thumbs up" on issues that others reported and that are relevant to you. It also helps us if you spread the word: reference the project from your blog and articles, link to it from your website, or simply star to say "I use it".

In case a contribution/issue involves changes to the API principles or changes to dependencies or supported versions, it must be backed by a [Enhancement proposals (SLEPs)](https://scikit-learn-enhancement-proposals.readthedocs.io/), where a SLEP must be submitted as a pull-request to [enhancement proposals](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals) using the [SLEP template](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/blob/main/slep_template.md) and follows the decision-making process outlined in [Scikit-learn governance and decision-making](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/governance.html).

## Automated Contributions Policy

Please refrain from submitting issues or pull requests generated by fully-automated tools. Maintainers reserve the right, at their sole discretion, to close such submissions and to block any account responsible for them.

Ideally, contributions should follow from a human-to-human discussion in the form of an issue.

## Submitting a Bug Report or Feature Request

We use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to open an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.

In case you experience issues using this package, do not hesitate to submit a ticket to the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues). You are also welcome to post feature requests or pull requests.

It is recommended to check that your issue complies with the following rules before submitting:

- Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other [issues](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pulls).
- If you are submitting an algorithm or feature request, please verify that the algorithm fulfills our [new algorithm requirements](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#new-algorithms).
- If you are submitting a bug report, we strongly encourage you to follow the guidelines in [How to make a good bug report](#how-to-make-a-good-bug-report).

### How to Make a Good Bug Report

When you submit an issue to GitHub, please do your best to follow these guidelines! This will make it a lot easier to provide you with good feedback:

- The ideal bug report contains a **short reproducible code snippet**, this way anyone can try to reproduce the bug easily. If your snippet is longer than around 50 lines, please link to a [Gist](https://gist.github.com) or a GitHub repo.

- If not feasible to include a reproducible snippet, please be specific about what **estimators and/or functions are involved and the shape of the data**.

- If an exception is raised, please **provide the full traceback**.

- Please include your **operating system type and version number**, as well as your **Python, scikit-learn, numpy, and scipy versions**. This information can be found by running:

```python
python -c "import sklearn; sklearn.show_versions()"
```

- Please ensure all **code snippets and error messages are formatted in appropriate code blocks**. See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) for more details.

If you want to help curate issues, read about [Bug triaging and issue curation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/bug_triaging.html).

## Contributing Code

> **Note**  
> To avoid duplicating work, it is highly advised that you search through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues) and the [PR list](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pulls). If in doubt about duplicated work, or if you want to work on a non-trivial feature, it's recommended to first open an issue in the issue tracker to get some feedback from core developers.

One easy way to find an issue to work on is by applying the ["help wanted"](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/labels/help%20wanted) label in your search. This lists all the issues that have been unclaimed so far. In order to claim an issue for yourself, please comment exactly `/take` on it for the CI to automatically assign the issue to you.

To maintain the quality of the codebase and ease the review process, any contribution must conform to the project's coding guidelines, in particular:

- Don't modify unrelated lines to keep the PR focused on the scope stated in its description or issue.
- Only write inline comments that add value and avoid stating the obvious: explain the "why" rather than the "what".
- **Most importantly**: Do not contribute code that you don't understand.

> **Note**  
> In January 2021, the default branch name changed from `master` to `main` for the scikit-learn GitHub repository to use more inclusive terms. These videos were created prior to the renaming of the branch. For contributors who are viewing these videos to set up their working environment and submitting a PR, `master` should be replaced to `main`.

### How to Contribute

The preferred way to contribute to scikit-learn is to fork the main repository on GitHub, then submit a "pull request" (PR).

In the first few steps, we explain how to locally install scikit-learn, and how to set up your git repository:

1. **Create an account on GitHub** if you do not already have one.

2. **Fork the project repository**: click on the 'Fork' button near the top of the page. This creates a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub user account. For more details on how to fork a repository see [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

3. **Clone your fork** of the scikit-learn repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/scikit-learn.git  # add --depth 1 if your connection is slow
cd scikit-learn
```

4. **Follow steps 2-6** in [Building from source](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/advanced_installation.html#building-from-source) to build scikit-learn in development mode and return to this document.

5. **Install the development dependencies**:

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-cov ruff==0.11.2 mypy numpydoc
```

6. **Add the upstream remote**. This saves a reference to the main scikit-learn repository, which you can use to keep your repository synchronized with the latest changes:

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git
```

7. **Check that the upstream and origin remote aliases are configured correctly** by running:

```bash
git remote -v
```

This should display:
```
origin    git@github.com:YourLogin/scikit-learn.git (fetch)
origin    git@github.com:YourLogin/scikit-learn.git (push)
upstream  git@github.com:scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git (fetch)
upstream  git@github.com:scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git (push)
```

You should now have a working installation of scikit-learn, and your git repository properly configured. It could be useful to run some test to verify your installation. Please refer to [Useful pytest aliases and flags](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/tips.html#pytest-tips) for examples.

The next steps now describe the process of modifying code and submitting a PR:

8. **Synchronize your main branch** with the upstream/main branch, more details on [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork):

```bash
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

9. **Create a feature branch** to hold your development changes:

```bash
git checkout -b my_feature
```

and start making changes. Always use a feature branch. It's good practice to never work on the main branch!

10. **(Optional) Install pre-commit** to run code style checks before each commit:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

pre-commit checks can be disabled for a particular commit with `git commit -n`.

11. **Develop the feature** on your feature branch on your computer, using Git to do the version control. When you're done editing, add changed files using `git add` and then `git commit`:

```bash
git add modified_files
git commit
```

to record your changes in Git, then push the changes to your GitHub account with:

```bash
git push -u origin my_feature
```

12. **Follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)** to create a pull request from your fork. This will send a notification to potential reviewers. You may want to consider sending a message to the [discord](https://discord.gg/h9qyrK8Jc8) in the development channel for more visibility if your pull request does not receive attention after a couple of days (instant replies are not guaranteed though).

It is often helpful to keep your local feature branch synchronized with the latest changes of the main scikit-learn repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

Subsequently, you might need to solve the conflicts. You can refer to the [Git documentation related to resolving merge conflict using the command line](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line).

#### Learning Git

The [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) and http://try.github.io are excellent resources to get started with git, and understanding all of the commands shown here.

### Pull Request Checklist

Before a PR can be merged, it needs to be approved by two core developers. An incomplete contribution – where you expect to do more work before receiving a full review – should be marked as a [draft pull request](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) and changed to "ready for review" when it matures. Draft PRs may be useful to: indicate you are working on something to avoid duplicated work, request broad review of functionality or API, or seek collaborators. Draft PRs often benefit from the inclusion of a task list in the PR description.

In order to ease the reviewing process, we recommend that your contribution complies with the following rules before marking a PR as "ready for review". The **bolded** ones are especially important:

- **Give your pull request a helpful title** that summarizes what your contribution does. This title will often become the commit message once merged so it should summarize your contribution for posterity. In some cases "Fix <ISSUE TITLE>" is enough. "Fix #<ISSUE NUMBER>" is never a good title.

- **Make sure your code passes the tests**. The whole test suite can be run with `pytest`, but it is usually not recommended since it takes a long time. It is often enough to only run the test related to your changes: for example, if you changed something in `sklearn/linear_model/_logistic.py`, running the following commands will usually be enough:

  - `pytest sklearn/linear_model/_logistic.py` to make sure the doctest examples are correct
  - `pytest sklearn/linear_model/tests/test_logistic.py` to run the tests specific to the file
  - `pytest sklearn/linear_model` to test the whole linear_model module
  - `pytest doc/modules/linear_model.rst` to make sure the user guide examples are correct.
  - `pytest sklearn/tests/test_common.py -k LogisticRegression` to run all our estimator checks (specifically for LogisticRegression, if that's the estimator you changed).

  There may be other failing tests, but they will be caught by the CI so you don't need to run the whole test suite locally. For guidelines on how to use pytest efficiently, see the [Useful pytest aliases and flags](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/tips.html#pytest-tips).

- **Make sure your code is properly commented and documented**, and make sure the documentation renders properly. To build the documentation, please refer to our [Documentation guidelines](#documentation). The CI will also build the docs: please refer to [Generated documentation on GitHub Actions](#generated-documentation-on-github-actions).

- **Tests are necessary** for enhancements to be accepted. Bug-fixes or new features should be provided with non-regression tests. These tests verify the correct behavior of the fix or feature. In this manner, further modifications on the code base are granted to be consistent with the desired behavior. In the case of bug fixes, at the time of the PR, the non-regression tests should fail for the code base in the main branch and pass for the PR code.

- If your PR is likely to affect users, you need to add a **changelog entry** describing your PR changes. See the [README](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/tree/main/doc/whats_new) for more details.

- **Follow the [Coding guidelines](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#coding-guidelines)**.

- When applicable, use the validation tools and scripts in the `sklearn.utils` module. A list of utility routines available for developers can be found in the [Utilities for Developers](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/utilities.html) page.

- Often pull requests resolve one or more other issues (or pull requests). If merging your pull request means that some other issues/PRs should be closed, you should use keywords to create link to them (e.g., `Fixes #1234`; multiple issues/PRs are allowed as long as each one is preceded by a keyword). Upon merging, those issues/PRs will automatically be closed by GitHub. If your pull request is simply related to some other issues/PRs, or it only partially resolves the target issue, create a link to them without using the keywords (e.g., `Towards #1234`).

- PRs should often substantiate the change, through benchmarks of performance and efficiency (see [Monitoring performance](#monitoring-performance)) or through examples of usage. Examples also illustrate the features and intricacies of the library to users. Have a look at other examples in the `examples/` directory for reference. Examples should demonstrate why the new functionality is useful in practice and, if possible, compare it to other methods available in scikit-learn.

- **New features have some maintenance overhead**. We expect PR authors to take part in the maintenance for the code they submit, at least initially. New features need to be illustrated with narrative documentation in the user guide, with small code snippets. If relevant, please also add references in the literature, with PDF links when possible.

- The user guide should also include expected time and space complexity of the algorithm and scalability, e.g. "this algorithm can scale to a large number of samples > 100000, but does not scale in dimensionality: n_features is expected to be lower than 100".

- You can also check our [Code Review Guidelines](#code-review-guidelines) to get an idea of what reviewers will expect.

You can check for common programming errors with the following tools:

- **Code with a good unit test coverage** (at least 80%, better 100%), check with:

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-cov
pytest --cov sklearn path/to/tests
```

See also [Testing and improving test coverage](#testing-and-improving-test-coverage).

- **Run static analysis with mypy**:

```bash
mypy sklearn
```

This must not produce new errors in your pull request. Using `# type: ignore` annotation can be a workaround for a few cases that are not supported by mypy, in particular,

  - when importing C or Cython modules,
  - on properties with decorators.

- Bonus points for contributions that include a performance analysis with a benchmark script and profiling output (see [Monitoring performance](#monitoring-performance)). Also check out the [How to optimize for speed](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/performance.html) guide for more details on profiling and Cython optimizations.

> **Note**  
> The current state of the scikit-learn code base is not compliant with all of those guidelines, but we expect that enforcing those constraints on all new contributions will get the overall code base quality in the right direction.

> **See also**  
> For two very well documented and more detailed guides on development workflow, please pay a visit to the [Scipy Development Workflow](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/dev/contributor/development_workflow.html) and the [Astropy Workflow for Developers](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/workflow/development_workflow.html) sections.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

[Azure pipelines](https://dev.azure.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/_build) are used for testing scikit-learn on Linux, Mac and Windows, with different dependencies and settings.

[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) is used to build the docs for viewing.

[Github Actions](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/actions) are used for various tasks, including building wheels and source distributions.

#### Commit Message Markers

Please note that if one of the following markers appears in the latest commit message, the following actions are taken.

| Commit Message Marker | Action Taken by CI |
|---|---|
| `[ci skip]` | CI is skipped completely |
| `[cd build]` | CD is run (wheels and source distribution are built) |
| `[lint skip]` | Azure pipeline skips linting |
| `[scipy-dev]` | Build & test with our dependencies (numpy, scipy, etc.) development builds |
| `[free-threaded]` | Build & test with CPython 3.13 free-threaded |
| `[pyodide]` | Build & test with Pyodide |
| `[azure parallel]` | Run Azure CI jobs in parallel |
| `[float32]` | Run float32 tests by setting `SKLEARN_RUN_FLOAT32_TESTS=1`. See [Environment variables](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/tips.html#environment-variables) for more details |
| `[doc skip]` | Docs are not built |
| `[doc quick]` | Docs built, but excludes example gallery plots |
| `[doc build]` | Docs built including example gallery plots (very long) |

Note that, by default, the documentation is built but only the examples that are directly modified by the pull request are executed.

#### Resolve Conflicts in Lock Files

Here is a bash snippet that helps resolving conflicts in environment and lock files:

```bash
# pull latest upstream/main
git pull upstream main --no-rebase
# resolve conflicts - keeping the upstream/main version for specific files
git checkout --theirs  build_tools/*/*.lock build_tools/*/*environment.yml \
    build_tools/*/*lock.txt build_tools/*/*requirements.txt
git add build_tools/*/*.lock build_tools/*/*environment.yml \
    build_tools/*/*lock.txt build_tools/*/*requirements.txt
git merge --continue
```

This will merge upstream/main into our branch, automatically prioritising the upstream/main for conflicting environment and lock files (this is good enough, because we will re-generate the lock files afterwards).

Note that this only fixes conflicts in environment and lock files and you might have other conflicts to resolve.

Finally, we have to re-generate the environment and lock files for the CIs by running:

```bash
python build_tools/update_environments_and_lock_files.py
```

### Stalled Pull Requests

As contributing a feature can be a lengthy process, some pull requests appear inactive but unfinished. In such a case, taking them over is a great service for the project. A good etiquette to take over is:

#### Determine if a PR is Stalled

- A pull request may have the label "stalled" or "help wanted" if we have already identified it as a candidate for other contributors.

- To decide whether an inactive PR is stalled, ask the contributor if she/he plans to continue working on the PR in the near future. Failure to respond within 2 weeks with an activity that moves the PR forward suggests that the PR is stalled and will result in tagging that PR with "help wanted".

- Note that if a PR has received earlier comments on the contribution that have had no reply in a month, it is safe to assume that the PR is stalled and to shorten the wait time to one day.

- After a sprint, follow-up for un-merged PRs opened during sprint will be communicated to participants at the sprint, and those PRs will be tagged "sprint". PRs tagged with "sprint" can be reassigned or declared stalled by sprint leaders.

#### Taking Over a Stalled PR

To take over a PR, it is important to comment on the stalled PR that you are taking over and to link from the new PR to the old one. The new PR should be created by pulling from the old one.

### Stalled and Unclaimed Issues

Generally speaking, issues which are up for grabs will have a ["help wanted"](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/labels/help%20wanted) tag. However, not all issues which need contributors will have this tag, as the "help wanted" tag is not always up-to-date with the state of the issue. Contributors can find issues which are still up for grabs using the following guidelines:

First, to determine if an issue is claimed:

- Check for linked pull requests
- Check the conversation to see if anyone has said that they're working on creating a pull request

If a contributor comments on an issue to say they are working on it, a pull request is expected within 2 weeks (new contributor) or 4 weeks (contributor or core dev), unless a larger time frame is explicitly given. Beyond that time, another contributor can take the issue and make a pull request for it. We encourage contributors to comment directly on the stalled or unclaimed issue to let community members know that they will be working on it.

If the issue is linked to a stalled pull request, we recommend that contributors follow the procedure described in the [Stalled pull requests](#stalled-pull-requests) section rather than working directly on the issue.

### Issues for New Contributors

New contributors should look for the following tags when looking for issues. We strongly recommend that new contributors tackle "easy" issues first: this helps the contributor become familiar with the contribution workflow, and for the core devs to become acquainted with the contributor; besides which, we frequently underestimate how easy an issue is to solve!

#### Good First Issue Tag

A great way to start contributing to scikit-learn is to pick an item from the list of [good first issues](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/labels/good%20first%20issue) in the issue tracker. Resolving these issues allows you to start contributing to the project without much prior knowledge. If you have already contributed to scikit-learn, you should look at [Easy issues](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/labels/Easy) instead.

#### Easy Tag

If you have already contributed to scikit-learn, another great way to contribute to scikit-learn is to pick an item from the list of [Easy issues](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/labels/Easy) in the issue tracker. Your assistance in this area will be greatly appreciated by the more experienced developers as it helps free up their time to concentrate on other issues.

#### Help Wanted Tag

We often use the [help wanted](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/labels/help%20wanted) tag to mark issues regardless of difficulty. Additionally, we use the help wanted tag to mark Pull Requests which have been abandoned by their original contributor and are available for someone to pick up where the original contributor left off. The list of issues with the help wanted tag can be found [here](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/labels/help%20wanted). Note that not all issues which need contributors will have this tag.

## Documentation

We are glad to accept any sort of documentation:

- **Function/method/class docstrings**: Also known as "API documentation", these describe what the object does and detail any parameters, attributes and methods. Docstrings live alongside the code in `sklearn/`, and are generated according to `doc/api_reference.py`. To add, update, remove, or deprecate a public API that is listed in [API Reference](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html), this is the place to look at.

- **User guide**: These provide more detailed information about the algorithms implemented in scikit-learn and generally live in the root `doc/` directory and `doc/modules/`.

- **Examples**: These provide full code examples that may demonstrate the use of scikit-learn modules, compare different algorithms or discuss their interpretation, etc. Examples live in `examples/`.

- **Other reStructuredText documents**: These provide various other useful information (e.g., the Contributing guide) and live in `doc/`.

You can use pytest to test docstrings, e.g. assuming the `RandomForestClassifier` docstring has been modified, the following command would test its docstring compliance:

```bash
pytest --doctest-modules sklearn/ensemble/_forest.py -k RandomForestClassifier
```

The correct order of sections is: **Parameters**, **Returns**, **See Also**, **Notes**, **Examples**. See the [numpydoc documentation](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/) for information on other possible sections.

When documenting the parameters and attributes, here is a list of some well-formatted examples:

```python
n_clusters : int, default=3
    The number of clusters detected by the algorithm.

some_param : {"hello", "goodbye"}, bool or int, default=True
    The parameter description goes here, which can be either a string
    literal (either `hello` or `goodbye`), a bool, or an int. The default
    value is True.

array_parameter : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features) \
    or (n_samples,)
    This parameter accepts data in either of the mentioned forms, with one
    of the mentioned shapes. The default value is `np.ones(shape=(n_samples,))`.

list_param : list of int

typed_ndarray : ndarray of shape (n_samples,), dtype=np.int32

sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None

multioutput_array : ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_classes) or list of such arrays
```

In general have the following in mind:

- Use Python basic types. (`bool` instead of `boolean`)
- Use parenthesis for defining shapes: `array-like of shape (n_samples,)` or `array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)`
- For strings with multiple options, use brackets: `input: {'log', 'squared', 'multinomial'}`
- 1D or 2D data can be a subset of `{array-like, ndarray, sparse matrix, dataframe}`. Note that `array-like` can also be a list, while `ndarray` is explicitly only a `numpy.ndarray`.
- Specify `dataframe` when "frame-like" features are being used, such as the column names.
- When specifying the data type of a list, use `of` as a delimiter: `list of int`. When the parameter supports arrays giving details about the shape and/or data type and a list of such arrays, you can use one of `array-like of shape (n_samples,) or list of such arrays`.
- When specifying the dtype of an ndarray, use e.g. `dtype=np.int32` after defining the shape: `ndarray of shape (n_samples,), dtype=np.int32`. You can specify multiple dtype as a set: `array-like of shape (n_samples,), dtype={np.float64, np.float32}`. If one wants to mention arbitrary precision, use `integral` and `floating` rather than the Python dtype `int` and `float`. When both `int` and `floating` are supported, there is no need to specify the dtype.
- When the default is `None`, `None` only needs to be specified at the end with `default=None`. Be sure to include in the docstring, what it means for the parameter or attribute to be `None`.
- Add "See Also" in docstrings for related classes/functions.
- "See Also" in docstrings should be one line per reference, with a colon and an explanation, for example:

```rst
See Also
--------
SelectKBest : Select features based on the k highest scores.
SelectFpr : Select features based on a false positive rate test.
```

- The "Notes" section is optional. It is meant to provide information on specific behavior of a function/class/classmethod/method.
- A Note can also be added to an attribute, but in that case it requires using the `.. rubric:: Note` directive.
- Add one or two snippets of code in "Example" section to show how it can be used. The code should be runable as is, i.e. it should include all required imports. Keep this section as brief as possible.

You can edit the documentation using any text editor, and then generate the HTML output by following [Building the documentation](#building-the-documentation). The resulting HTML files will be placed in `_build/html/` and are viewable in a web browser, for instance by opening the local `_build/html/index.html` file or by running a local server:

```bash
python -m http.server -d _build/html
```

### Building the Documentation

Before submitting a pull request check if your modifications have introduced new sphinx warnings by building the documentation locally and try to fix them.

First, make sure you have properly installed the development version. On top of that, building the documentation requires installing some additional packages:

```bash
pip install sphinx sphinx-gallery numpydoc matplotlib Pillow pandas \
            polars scikit-image packaging seaborn sphinx-prompt \
            sphinxext-opengraph sphinx-copybutton plotly pooch \
            pydata-sphinx-theme sphinxcontrib-sass sphinx-design \
            sphinx-remove-toctrees
```

To build the documentation, you need to be in the doc folder:

```bash
cd doc
```

In the vast majority of cases, you only need to generate the web site without the example gallery:

```bash
make
```

The documentation will be generated in the `_build/html/stable` directory and are viewable in a web browser, for instance by opening the local `_build/html/stable/index.html` file. To also generate the example gallery you can use:

```bash
make html
```

This will run all the examples, which takes a while. You can also run only a few examples based on their file names. Here is a way to run all examples with filenames containing `plot_calibration`:

```bash
EXAMPLES_PATTERN="plot_calibration" make html
```

You can use regular expressions for more advanced use cases.

Set the environment variable `NO_MATHJAX=1` if you intend to view the documentation in an offline setting. To build the PDF manual, run:

```bash
make latexpdf
```

> **Sphinx Version**  
> While we do our best to have the documentation build under as many versions of Sphinx as possible, the different versions tend to behave slightly differently. To get the best results, you should use the same version as the one we used on CircleCI. Look at [this GitHub search](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ascikit-learn%2Fscikit-learn+sphinx&type=code) to know the exact version.

### Generated Documentation on GitHub Actions

When you change the documentation in a pull request, GitHub Actions automatically builds it. To view the documentation generated by GitHub Actions, simply go to the bottom of your PR page, look for the item "Check the rendered docs here!" and click on 'details' next to it:

## Testing and Improving Test Coverage

High-quality unit testing is a corner-stone of the scikit-learn development process. For this purpose, we use the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) package. The tests are functions appropriately named, located in `tests` subdirectories, that check the validity of the algorithms and the different options of the code.

Running `pytest` in a folder will run all the tests of the corresponding subpackages. For a more detailed pytest workflow, please refer to the [Pull request checklist](#pull-request-checklist).

We expect code coverage of new features to be at least around 90%.

## Monitoring Performance

This section is heavily inspired from the [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/development/contributing.html#performance).

When proposing changes to the existing code base, it's important to make sure that they don't introduce performance regressions. Scikit-learn uses [asv benchmarks](https://asv.readthedocs.io/) to monitor the performance of a selection of common estimators and functions. You can view these benchmarks on the [scikit-learn benchmark page](https://scikit-learn.org/scikit-learn-benchmarks/). The corresponding benchmark suite can be found in the `asv_benchmarks/` directory.

To use all features of asv, you will need either `conda` or `virtualenv`. For more details please check the [asv installation webpage](https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing.html).

First of all you need to install the development version of asv:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/airspeed-velocity/asv
```

and change your directory to `asv_benchmarks/`:

```bash
cd asv_benchmarks
```

The benchmark suite is configured to run against your local clone of scikit-learn. Make sure it is up to date:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

In the benchmark suite, the benchmarks are organized following the same structure as scikit-learn. For example, you can compare the performance of a specific estimator between upstream/main and the branch you are working on:

```bash
asv continuous -b LogisticRegression upstream/main HEAD
```

The command uses `conda` by default for creating the benchmark environments. If you want to use `virtualenv` instead, use the `-E` flag:

```bash
asv continuous -E virtualenv -b LogisticRegression upstream/main HEAD
```

You can also specify a whole module to benchmark:

```bash
asv continuous -b linear_model upstream/main HEAD
```

You can replace `HEAD` by any local branch. By default it will only report the benchmarks that have changed by at least 10%. You can control this ratio with the `-f` flag.

To run the full benchmark suite, simply remove the `-b` flag:

```bash
asv continuous upstream/main HEAD
```

However this can take up to two hours. The `-b` flag also accepts a regular expression for a more complex subset of benchmarks to run.

To run the benchmarks without comparing to another branch, use the `run` command:

```bash
asv run -b linear_model HEAD^!
```

You can also run the benchmark suite using the version of scikit-learn already installed in your current Python environment:

```bash
asv run --python=same
```

It's particularly useful when you installed scikit-learn in editable mode to avoid creating a new environment each time you run the benchmarks. By default the results are not saved when using an existing installation. To save the results you must specify a commit hash:

```bash
asv run --python=same --set-commit-hash=<commit hash>
```

Benchmarks are saved and organized by machine, environment and commit. To see the list of all saved benchmarks:

```bash
asv show
```

and to see the report of a specific run:

```bash
asv show <commit hash>
```

When running benchmarks for a pull request you're working on please report the results on github.

The benchmark suite supports additional configurable options which can be set in the `benchmarks/config.json` configuration file. For example, the benchmarks can run for a provided list of values for the `n_jobs` parameter.

More information on how to write a benchmark and how to use asv can be found in the [asv documentation](https://asv.readthedocs.io/).

## Issue Tracker Tags

All issues and pull requests on the GitHub issue tracker should have (at least) one of the following tags:

- **Bug**: Something is happening that clearly shouldn't happen. Wrong results as well as unexpected errors from estimators go here.
- **Enhancement**: Improving performance, usability, consistency.
- **Documentation**: Missing, incorrect or sub-standard documentations and examples.
- **New Feature**: Feature requests and pull requests implementing a new feature.

There are four other tags to help new contributors:

- **Good first issue**: This issue is ideal for a first contribution to scikit-learn. Ask for help if the formulation is unclear. If you have already contributed to scikit-learn, look at Easy issues instead.
- **Easy**: This issue can be tackled without much prior experience.
- **Moderate**: Might need some knowledge of machine learning or the package, but is still approachable for someone new to the project.
- **Help wanted**: This tag marks an issue which currently lacks a contributor or a PR that needs another contributor to take over the work. These issues can range in difficulty, and may not be approachable for new contributors. Note that not all issues which need contributors will have this tag.

## Maintaining Backwards Compatibility

### Deprecation

If any publicly accessible class, function, method, attribute or parameter is renamed, we still support the old one for two releases and issue a deprecation warning when it is called, passed, or accessed.

#### Deprecating a Class or a Function

Suppose the function `zero_one` is renamed to `zero_one_loss`, we add the decorator `utils.deprecated` to `zero_one` and call `zero_one_loss` from that function:

```python
from ..utils import deprecated

def zero_one_loss(y_true, y_pred, normalize=True):
    # actual implementation
    pass

@deprecated(
    "Function `zero_one` was renamed to `zero_one_loss` in 0.13 and will be "
    "removed in 0.15. Default behavior is changed from `normalize=False` to "
    "`normalize=True`"
)
def zero_one(y_true, y_pred, normalize=False):
    return zero_one_loss(y_true, y_pred, normalize)
```

One also needs to move `zero_one` from `API_REFERENCE` to `DEPRECATED_API_REFERENCE` and add `zero_one_loss` to `API_REFERENCE` in the `doc/api_reference.py` file to reflect the changes in [API Reference](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html).

#### Deprecating an Attribute or a Method

If an attribute or a method is to be deprecated, use the decorator `deprecated` on the property. Please note that the deprecated decorator should be placed before the property decorator if there is one, so that the docstrings can be rendered properly. For instance, renaming an attribute `labels_` to `classes_` can be done as:

```python
@deprecated(
    "Attribute `labels_` was deprecated in 0.13 and will be removed in 0.15. Use "
    "`classes_` instead"
)
@property
def labels_(self):
    return self.classes_
```

#### Deprecating a Parameter

If a parameter has to be deprecated, a `FutureWarning` warning must be raised manually. In the following example, `k` is deprecated and renamed to `n_clusters`:

```python
import warnings

def example_function(n_clusters=8, k="deprecated"):
    if k != "deprecated":
        warnings.warn(
            "`k` was renamed to `n_clusters` in 0.13 and will be removed in 0.15",
            FutureWarning,
        )
        n_clusters = k
```

When the change is in a class, we validate and raise warning in fit:

```python
import warnings

class ExampleEstimator(BaseEstimator):
    def __init__(self, n_clusters=8, k='deprecated'):
        self.n_clusters = n_clusters
        self.k = k

    def fit(self, X, y):
        if self.k != "deprecated":
            warnings.warn(
                "`k` was renamed to `n_clusters` in 0.13 and will be removed in 0.15.",
                FutureWarning,
            )
            self._n_clusters = self.k
        else:
            self._n_clusters = self.n_clusters
```

As in these examples, the warning message should always give both the version in which the deprecation happened and the version in which the old behavior will be removed. If the deprecation happened in version 0.x-dev, the message should say deprecation occurred in version 0.x and the removal will be in 0.(x+2), so that users will have enough time to adapt their code to the new behaviour. For example, if the deprecation happened in version 0.18-dev, the message should say it happened in version 0.18 and the old behavior will be removed in version 0.20.

The warning message should also include a brief explanation of the change and point users to an alternative.

In addition, a deprecation note should be added in the docstring, recalling the same information as the deprecation warning as explained above. Use the `.. deprecated::` directive:

```rst
.. deprecated:: 0.13
   ``k`` was renamed to ``n_clusters`` in version 0.13 and will be removed
   in 0.15.
```

What's more, a deprecation requires a test which ensures that the warning is raised in relevant cases but not in other cases. The warning should be caught in all other tests (using e.g., `@pytest.mark.filterwarnings`), and there should be no warning in the examples.

### Change the Default Value of a Parameter

If the default value of a parameter needs to be changed, please replace the default value with a specific value (e.g., `"warn"`) and raise `FutureWarning` when users are using the default value. The following example assumes that the current version is 0.20 and that we change the default value of `n_clusters` from 5 (old default for 0.20) to 10 (new default for 0.22):

```python
import warnings

def example_function(n_clusters="warn"):
    if n_clusters == "warn":
        warnings.warn(
            "The default value of `n_clusters` will change from 5 to 10 in 0.22.",
            FutureWarning,
        )
        n_clusters = 5
```

When the change is in a class, we validate and raise warning in fit:

```python
import warnings

class ExampleEstimator:
    def __init__(self, n_clusters="warn"):
        self.n_clusters = n_clusters

    def fit(self, X, y):
        if self.n_clusters == "warn":
            warnings.warn(
                "The default value of `n_clusters` will change from 5 to 10 in 0.22.",
                FutureWarning,
            )
            self._n_clusters = 5
```

Similar to deprecations, the warning message should always give both the version in which the change happened and the version in which the old behavior will be removed.

The parameter description in the docstring needs to be updated accordingly by adding a `versionchanged` directive with the old and new default value, pointing to the version when the change will be effective:

```rst
.. versionchanged:: 0.22
   The default value for `n_clusters` will change from 5 to 10 in version 0.22.
```

Finally, we need a test which ensures that the warning is raised in relevant cases but not in other cases. The warning should be caught in all other tests (using e.g., `@pytest.mark.filterwarnings`), and there should be no warning in the examples.

## Code Review Guidelines

Reviewing code contributed to the project as PRs is a crucial component of scikit-learn development. We encourage anyone to start reviewing code of other developers. The code review process is often highly educational for everybody involved. This is particularly appropriate if it is a feature you would like to use, and so can respond critically about whether the PR meets your needs. While each pull request needs to be signed off by two core developers, you can speed up this process by providing your feedback.

> **Note**  
> The difference between an objective improvement and a subjective nit isn't always clear. Reviewers should recall that code review is primarily about reducing risk in the project. When reviewing code, one should aim at preventing situations which may require a bug fix, a deprecation, or a retraction. Regarding docs: typos, grammar issues and disambiguations are better addressed immediately.

## Reading the Existing Code Base

Reading and digesting an existing code base is always a difficult exercise that takes time and experience to master. Even though we try to write simple code in general, understanding the code can seem overwhelming at first, given the sheer size of the project. Here is a list of tips that may help make this task easier and faster (in no particular order).

- Get acquainted with the APIs of scikit-learn objects: understand what `fit`, `predict`, `transform`, etc. are used for.

- Before diving into reading the code of a function / class, go through the docstrings first and try to get an idea of what each parameter / attribute is doing. It may also help to stop a minute and think _how would I do this myself if I had to?_

- The trickiest thing is often to identify which portions of the code are relevant, and which are not. In scikit-learn **a lot** of input checking is performed, especially at the beginning of the fit methods. Sometimes, only a very small portion of the code is doing the actual job. For example looking at the fit method of `LinearRegression`, what you're looking for might just be the call the `scipy.linalg.lstsq`, but it is buried into multiple lines of input checking and the handling of different kinds of parameters.

- Due to the use of Inheritance, some methods may be implemented in parent classes. All estimators inherit at least from `BaseEstimator`, and from a `Mixin` class (e.g. `ClassifierMixin`) that enables default behaviour depending on the nature of the estimator (classifier, regressor, transformer, etc.).

- Sometimes, reading the tests for a given function will give you an idea of what its intended purpose is. You can use `git grep` (see below) to find all the tests written for a function. Most tests for a specific function/class are placed under the `tests/` folder of the module

- You'll often see code looking like this: `out = Parallel(...)(delayed(some_function)(param) for param in some_iterable)`. This runs `some_function` in parallel using [Joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/). `out` is then an iterable containing the values returned by `some_function` for each call.

- We use [Cython](https://cython.org/) to write fast code. Cython code is located in `.pyx` and `.pxd` files. Cython code has a more C-like flavor: we use pointers, perform manual memory allocation, etc. Having some minimal experience in C / C++ is pretty much mandatory here. For more information see [Cython Best Practices, Conventions and Knowledge](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/cython.html).

- **Master your tools.**

  - With such a big project, being efficient with your favorite editor or IDE goes a long way towards digesting the code base. Being able to quickly jump (or _peek_) to a function/class/attribute definition helps a lot. So does being able to quickly see where a given name is used in a file.

  - Git also has some built-in killer features. It is often useful to understand how a file changed over time, using e.g. `git blame` ([manual](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame)). This can also be done directly on GitHub. `git grep` ([examples](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-grep#_examples)) is also extremely useful to see every occurrence of a pattern (e.g. a function call or a variable) in the code base.

- **Configure `git blame` to ignore the commit that migrated the code style to `black` and then `ruff`.**

```bash
git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
```
