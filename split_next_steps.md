# SPLIT to Scikit-Learn: Comprehensive Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the steps needed to make the SPLIT algorithms ready for submission as a scikit-learn pull request. Based on analysis of the current codebase and scikit-learn contribution guidelines, this roadmap provides a structured approach to achieving scikit-learn integration.

## Overview

The repository contains three main algorithms:
- **SPLIT**: Fast optimal decision tree learning with lookahead
- **LicketySPLIT**: Simplified version of SPLIT  
- **RESPLIT**: Rashomon set estimation for decision trees

For scikit-learn submission, we recommend starting with **SPLIT** as the primary contribution, with the others as potential future additions.

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Proposal Research and Community Engagement

### 1. Literature Review and Algorithm Validation
**Objective**: Validate algorithms meet scikit-learn's standards for new contributions

**Actions**:
- Document theoretical foundations from ICML 2025 paper
- Compare SPLIT advantages vs existing sklearn tree methods (`DecisionTreeClassifier`, `ExtraTreeClassifier`)
- Identify specific use cases where SPLIT provides clear benefits
- Prepare mathematical complexity analysis

**Why Critical**: Scikit-learn is highly selective about new algorithms - must demonstrate clear advantages and strong theoretical backing.

### 2. Community Pre-Proposal Discussion  
**Objective**: Engage scikit-learn maintainers early to ensure alignment

**Actions**:
- Open GitHub issue in scikit-learn repository proposing SPLIT addition
- Present algorithm benefits, use cases, and implementation approach
- Get initial feedback on feasibility and interest level
- Address any concerns about algorithm scope or overlap

**Why Critical**: Prevents wasted effort and ensures maintainer buy-in before heavy development work.

### 3. Algorithm Selection and Scope Definition
**Objective**: Focus efforts on most impactful contribution

**Actions**:
- Prioritize SPLIT as primary algorithm for first PR
- Document roadmap for LicketySPLIT and RESPLIT as future contributions
- Define clear success criteria and timeline
- Identify potential challenges and mitigation strategies

**Why Critical**: Three algorithms simultaneously would overwhelm reviewers - focused approach more likely to succeed.

## Phase 2: API Compliance and Core Implementation

### 4. Standardize Estimator API Compliance
**Objective**: Ensure full compatibility with scikit-learn estimator interface

**Current Issues**:
- `SPLIT` class doesn't inherit from `BaseEstimator`, `ClassifierMixin`
- Missing required attributes like `classes_`
- Inconsistent parameter validation

**Actions**:
```python
# Target API structure:
class SPLITClassifier(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin):
    def __init__(self, max_depth=6, regularization=0.001, 
                 lookahead_depth=3, time_limit=60, ...):
        # Only parameter assignment, no logic
        
    def fit(self, X, y, sample_weight=None):
        # Proper input validation
        # Return self
        
    def predict(self, X):
        # Standard prediction interface
        
    def predict_proba(self, X):
        # Probability predictions
```

**Why Critical**: API compliance is mandatory - non-negotiable for scikit-learn acceptance.

### 5. Parameter Naming and Validation Standardization
**Objective**: Align with scikit-learn conventions and add robust validation

**Current Issues**:
- Non-standard parameter names (`reg` instead of `regularization`)
- Inconsistent naming (`full_depth_budget` vs sklearn's `max_depth`)
- Limited input validation

**Actions**:
- Rename `full_depth_budget` → `max_depth`
- Rename `lookahead_depth_budget` → `lookahead_depth`  
- Add comprehensive input validation using sklearn utilities
- Ensure all parameters have sensible defaults
- Add parameter validation in `__init__` or `fit`

**Why Critical**: Consistent naming and validation expected by sklearn users.

### 6. Integration Location Planning
**Objective**: Determine optimal placement in scikit-learn module structure

**Options**:
- `sklearn.tree.SPLITClassifier` (alongside `DecisionTreeClassifier`)
- `sklearn.ensemble.SPLITClassifier` (if positioned as ensemble method)

**Actions**:
- Analyze existing tree module structure
- Consult with maintainers on preferred location
- Plan imports and module initialization

**Why Critical**: Proper organization affects discoverability and maintainability.

---

## Phase 3: Testing Infrastructure

### 7. Comprehensive Unit Testing
**Objective**: Achieve 90%+ test coverage meeting scikit-learn standards

**Current State**: Limited testing in `test.py` and `split/tests/`

**Required Tests**:
```python
# Core functionality tests
def test_split_fit_predict():
def test_split_multiclass():

```

**Actions**:
- Create comprehensive test suite in `sklearn/tree/tests/test_split.py`

- Add regression tests for known issues
- Ensure tests follow sklearn testing patterns

**Why Critical**: High test coverage is mandatory for sklearn acceptance.

### 8. Scikit-learn Compatibility Testing
**Objective**: Pass all sklearn estimator compliance checks

**Current Issue**: `test_compat_classifier` is commented out due to failures

**Actions**:
- Fix issues preventing `check_estimator` passage
- Ensure compliance with all sklearn API requirements:
  - Proper handling of `sample_weight`
  - Correct behavior with different data types
  - Appropriate error handling for invalid inputs
- Add automated compatibility testing to CI

**Why Critical**: `check_estimator` passage is required for sklearn integration.

### 9. Performance and Benchmark Testing  
**Objective**: Demonstrate algorithm advantages with empirical evidence

**Actions**:
- Create benchmarks comparing vs `DecisionTreeClassifier`, `ExtraTreeClassifier`
- Test on diverse datasets (tabular, high-dimensional, imbalanced)
- Measure training time, prediction time, and accuracy
- Document scenarios where SPLIT excels
- Add to sklearn benchmark suite

**Why Critical**: Performance justification required for new algorithm acceptance.
